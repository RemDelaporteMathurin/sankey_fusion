sankey-fusion is a web app creating parametric and interactive [Sankey diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) for fusion reactors.
Many parameters are tunable such as the amplification factor Q, the heating efficiency, the neutron energy multiplication, etc.

Sankey diagrams allow to visualise the balance and flow of energy in a system (here a fusion reactor).


sankey-fusion relies on [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and is deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
